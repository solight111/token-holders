This is a Javascript code to pull token holders from Blockscout. It prompts you to enter the contract you are getting holders from, as well as a multiplier for token airdrops. It outputs a CSV file in two columns, one for the token holder "Address",
and a second for the Max-Allowable colomn, with a header matching.

To run the script, download the files to a folder, cd "your/folder/name" and in the terminal type "node index.js" and follow the prompts. Fell free to use and share this code. It is not licensed, but open source.
